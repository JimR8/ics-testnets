## Status

* Timeline
  * 2022-11-28: The `strangelove-coordinator` validator will start signing on strange at `2022-11-28T14:00:00.000000Z`.
  * 2022-11-10: Spawn time: `2022-11-10T15:00:00.000000Z`
  * 2022-11-09: Proposal 2 voting period ends
  * 2022-11-07: Proposal 2 goes into voting period
  * 2022-11-07: Chain initialized

strange will launch as a consumer chain through a governance proposal in the `provider` chain. Read the [Consumer Chain Start Process](/docs/Consumer-Chain-Start-Process.md) page for more details about the workflow.

The following items will be included in the proposal:
* Genesis file hash
  * The SHA256 is used to verify against the genesis file that the proposer has made available for review.
  * This "fresh" genesis file cannot be used to run the chain: it must be updated with the CCV states after the spawn time is reached.
* Binary hash
* Spawn time
  * Even if the proposal passes, the CCV states will not be available from the provider chain until after the spawn time is reached.

## Chain Data

### Binary

The binary published in this repo is the `stranged` binary built using the `interchain-security` repo tag [v0.2.0](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/strange-chain/releases/tag/v0.2.0). You can generate the binary following the [build instructions](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security#instructions).

  * [Linux amd64 build](stranged)
  * SHA256: `changeme`

### Genesis file

**The genesis file for Interchain Security consumer chains must include the CCV (Cross Chain Validation) state generated by the provider chain _after_ the spawn time is reached.**

Final genesis file **with CCV state**: **[strange-genesis.json](strange-genesis.json)**
- SHA256: `changeme`
- Validators must replace their `config/genesis.json` file with this one before running the binary.

The genesis file with was generated using the following settings:

* Chain ID: `strange`
* Denom: `ustrange`
* Signed blocks window: `"8640"`
* Two additional genesis accounts were added to provide funds for a faucet and a relayer that will be run by the strangelove team.
* Genesis file **without CCV state**: [`strange-fresh-genesis.json`](strange-fresh-genesis.json), SHA256: `changeme`
  * **This is provided only for verification, this is not the genesis file validators should be running their nodes with.**

## Endpoints

* **p2p seeds : `changeme`**
* **p2p persistent peers : `changeme`**
* These peers represent the `strangelove-coordinator` validators (run by the strangelove team). 
* The `strangelove-coordinator` validator node has an overwhelming majority of the voting power, and we aim to start it two hours after the spawn time is reached. 67% of the voting power needs to come online for consumer chains to start. Once the `strangelove-coordinator` is live, the chain will progress.
* Please keep in mind that any validator that does not come online after 67% of the voting power is up and running, is likely to be slashed for downtime, potentially resulting in being jailed (the `signed_blocks_window` parameter is set to `8640`).

## Join via Bash Script

On the node machine:
- Copy the `node_key.json` and `priv_validator_key.json` files for your validator.
  - **These should be the same ones as the ones from your provider node**.
- Run one of the following scripts:
  - strange service: [strange-init.sh](strange-init.sh)
  - Cosmovisor service: [strange-init-cv.sh](strange-init-cv.sh)
- Wait until the spawn time is reached and the genesis file with the CCV states is available.
- Overwrite the genesis file with the one that includes the CCV states.
  - The default location is `$HOME/.strange/config/genesis.json`.
- Enable and start the service:
  - strange
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable strange
    sudo systemctl start strange
    ```
  - Cosmovisor
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable cv-strange
    sudo systemctl start cv-strange
    ```
- To follow the log, use:
  - strange: `journalctl -fu strange`
  - Cosmovisor: `journalctl -fu cv-strange`
- If the log does not show up right away, run `systemctl restart systemd-journald`.
